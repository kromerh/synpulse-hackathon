## Get AWS python package remote installed

- put in requirements.txt the packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt -t skill_env`

- copy the contents of the lambda/py folder into the skill_env folder.

- Pandas. Navigate to https://pypi.org/project/pandas/#files. Search for and download newest *manylinux1_x86_64.whl package. In my case for Python 3.6 is pandas-0.24.1-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl file.

- NumPy. Do the same for NumPy. File is numpy-1.16.1-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl.
